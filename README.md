# Automobile Risk & Pricing Analytics

## Exploratory Analysis Using Vehicle Attributes

---

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing automobile characteristics to understand how different vehicle attributes influence **pricing** and **insurance risk**. The analysis is grounded in a structured **data dictionary**, ensuring accurate interpretation of each variable before performing any analytical or visualization tasks.

The project demonstrates a disciplined analytics workflow, starting from data understanding and progressing toward business-oriented insights.

---

## Objective

The primary objectives of this project are to:

* Identify key factors that influence automobile prices
* Analyze how vehicle attributes affect insurance risk ratings
* Support data-driven pricing and risk assessment decisions
* Demonstrate best practices in data understanding and exploratory analysis

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains detailed information about automobiles, including:

* Vehicle identifiers
* Insurance risk ratings (symboling)
* Engine and performance characteristics
* Physical attributes such as body style and fuel type
* Pricing and cost-related variables

A separate **data dictionary** is used to define each variable clearly, ensuring correct usage and interpretation throughout the analysis.

---

## Role of the Data Dictionary

The data dictionary plays a critical role in this project by:

* Explaining the meaning and purpose of each variable
* Helping classify variables as numerical, categorical, or ordinal
* Preventing misinterpretation during analysis
* Supporting reliable and accurate business insights

This step reflects a professional, real-world analytics approach.

## Methodology

The project follows a structured analytics workflow:

1. **Data Understanding**
   Review variable definitions using the data dictionary

2. **Data Preparation**
   Clean and format the dataset for analysis

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   Analyze distributions, relationships, and patterns

4. **Visualization**
   Present findings using charts and dashboards

5. **Insight Generation**
   Translate analytical results into business-relevant conclusions

## Key Analytical Questions

* Which vehicle features have the strongest impact on price?
* How does insurance risk vary across vehicle types?
* Are certain body styles or engine configurations associated with higher risk?
* How can manufacturers and insurers use these insights for decision-making?
